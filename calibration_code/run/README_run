Steps for setting up and running the calibration:

1. First, prepare the INPUT_ORG_reference and INPUT_IO_reference
   files located in: ~/calibration/input/INPUT_ORG,
   and ~/calibration/input/INPUT_IO.  

2. Then, change the minima and maxima for the parameters in the generate_input.sh script
   if needed (found in ~/calibration/input)

3. Clean out the ~/calibration/input/INPUT_ORG, 
   and ~/calibration/input/INPUT_IO folders.  !! Don't delete the reference files!!

4. Run the generate_input.sh script to make all of the INPUT_ORG, 
   and INPUT_IO files.

5. Set the run_dir variable in the jobs/job_reference.sh, jobs/prepare_jobs.sh, and 
   run_calibration.sh script.

6. Clean out anything that is in the $run_dir folder.

7. Change the job_reference.sh script if needed (found in ~/calibration/jobs)

8. Run the prepare_jobs.sh script to generate the run folders and copy the variable
   input files to the run folders.  

9. Prepare and copy the other INPUT_ files to the $run_dir folder.

10. Copy the cclm executable to the $run_dir folder.  

11. Use the run_calibration.sh script to submit all of the Slurm batch jobs 
    (found in ~/calibration)
